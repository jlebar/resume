\section*{Software Engineer at Google}
\paragraph{2016--present} Tech lead (team of \textasciitilde{}10) and manager
(since 2018, team of \textasciitilde{}5) of Google's GPU compilers and
XLA:CPU/GPU teams.  We:

\begin{itemize}
\item Built the CPU and nVidia GPU backends for XLA, a compiler for ML.
  XLA:GPU is median \textbf{1.5x} faster than TensorFlow on fp16 models, and in
  particular gets state-of-the-art performance on Resnet50 without us writing
  hand-tuned kernels.  See \url{https://bit.ly/2CS5NCC}.
    
  TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, and Julia all have backends for XLA.

\item Added CUDA support in clang.  This was hard in part because there exists
  no spec for the CUDA language, and nVidia's compiler leaks implementation
  details into its behavior.  All of Google's CUDA code is compiled with
  clang now.

\item Added support for new nVidia GPUs in LLVM and fixed some deep bugs in
  LLVM's handling of GPU code.  This required at times deep debugging into GPU
  machine code, for which the only compiler is closed-source and for which
  there exists no public ISA.
\end{itemize}

My personal technical focus has been on performance optimization.  See also my
CppCon 2016 talk about GPUs and CUDA support in clang:
\url{https://youtu.be/KHa-OSrZPGo}.

\paragraph{2013--2016} Software Engineer on Census, a performance-monitoring
and debugging tool.  My primary focus was performance of the library, which ran
at immense scale.

\paragraph{Promos} Level 6 (2017 Q1), L5 (2014 Q3), started at L4.

I contributed to many different areas of the Firefox, but I was most passionate
about reducing Firefox's memory usage.  I was an official \textbf{reviewer of
seven modules} and a de facto owner/reviewer of many other pieces of code,
including Firefox's malloc implementation.

\begin{comment}
In the period between Jan.~1, 2012 and May~15, 2013, I was the \textbf{\nth{13}
most-prolific author} and the \textbf{\nth{15} most-prolific reviewer} of
commits in Mozilla's main source repository, out of \textasciitilde350 contributors
with more than 10 commits in this period.  Only three people both wrote and
reviewed more patches during this time.
